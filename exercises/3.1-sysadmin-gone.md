## HTTPD config

â†’ looks normal

checked `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` and `/etc/httpd/conf.d/*`

`httpd.conf` includes the proxy configuration

ProxyPass "/cmd" "http://localhost:8000/"
ProxyPassReverse "/aaa" "http://localhost:8000/"
ProxyPass "/assets" "http://localhost:8000/assets"
ProxyPassReverse "/assets" "http://localhost:8000/assets"
ProxyPass "/exec" "http://localhost:8000/exec"
ProxyPassReverse "/exec" "http://localhost:8000/exec"
```

## Database connection

```php
$servername = "172.30.0.15";
$username = "sammy";
$password = "FLAG-741852";
$database = "users";
```

## Custom systemd service

- the unit files is located in `/etc/systemd/system/insecurewebapp.service`

## Questions

The configuration of the webserver as a reverse proxy to
www.insecure.cyb/cmd.

- How is this setup, explore the reverse proxy
configuration and the systemd config file.
    - What port is the java app
    running? Where is the jar located?
        - Port 8000
        - `/opt/insecurewebapp/app.jar`
    - Where is the systemd configuration
    file located?
        - the unit files is located in `/etc/systemd/system/insecurewebapp.service`
    - How can you bring this application down without bringing
