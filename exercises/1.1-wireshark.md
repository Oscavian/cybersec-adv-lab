    Layer 1
    
    Layer 2 → Ethernet & ARP
    
    Layer 3 → IPv4 & IPv6 & ICMP
    
    Layer 4 → TCP & UDP

- Take a look at the conversations. What do you notice?
    - 172.30.42.4 is likely to be a DNS Server, received many requests from 172.30.128.11
    - only 2 different hosts on MAC address level: 172.30.128.11 & .10
    - 172.30.128.11 requestes a chromecast via Multicast DNS
    - 172.30.128.11 requests an web server at 172.30.42.2
    - one SSH conversation
- Take a look at the protocol hierarchy. What are the most "interesting" protocols listed here?
    - http
    - dns
- Can you spot an SSH session that got established between 2 machines? List the 2 machines. Who was the SSH server and who was the client? What ports were used? Are these ports TCP or UDP?
    - Client: 172.30.128.10:37700
    - Server: 172.30.42.2:22
    - TCP Connection
- Some cleartext data was transferred between two machines. Can you spot the data? Can you deduce what happened here?
    - using `ip.addr==172.30.128.11 && ip.addr==172.30.42.2 && http`
    - the webserver seems to host a simple website with a form that let’s the user enter arbitrary commands to be executed on the webserver, so this is a RCE vulnerability!
    - a POST to `/exec` executes the command `{"cmd":"ip a"}` in this example, the command output is then sent back to the client
- Someone used a specific way to transfer a png on the wire. Is it possible to export this png easily? Is it possible to export other HTTP related stuff?
    - using `ip.addr==172.30.128.11 && ip.addr==172.30.42.2 && http` or just `png`  we can easily see the GET request made to the PNG images
    - in fact, 2 images were requested: `/icons/poweredby.png` and `/poweredby.png`
    - By right clicking on the PNG tab, one can export and save the data as .png and view them
    - The pictures reveal that the webserver is an apache running on almalinux

|   IP | Supposed role | Notes |

## Installing attacker machine

- download kali virtualbox image
- import & startup
- enable ssh server `sudo systemctl enable ssh --now` for remote login

## Capture traffic using cli

Start at least the isprouter, the companyrouter, the dc and the win10
 client in your environment. For now you can still use the credentials 
vagrant/vagrant on all machines.

Install the `tcpdump`
 utility on the companyrouter and figure out a way to sniff traffic 
origination from the win10 using tcpdump on the companyrouter.

- Have a look at the ip configurations of the dc machine, the win10 client and the companyrouter.
    - DC:
        
        ```bash
        Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

    - companyrouter:

        ```
        
- Which interface on the companyrouter will you use to capture traffic from the dc to the internet?
    - eth1 resp. the internal interface
- Which interface on the companyrouter would you use to capture traffic from dc to win10?
    - eth1 resp. the internal interface
- Test this out by pinging from win10 to the companyrouter and from win10 to the dc.Are you able to see all pings in tcpdump on the companyrouter?
    - win10 → companyrouter  | captured on companyrouter
        
        ```bash
        [vagrant@companyrouter ~]$ sudo tcpdump -i eth1 icmp
        dropped privs to tcpdump
        tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode

        ```
        
    - win10 → dc  captured on companyrouter
        - no result, traffic does not pass the companyrouter bc win10 and dc are in the same subnet 172.30.0.0/16
- Figure out a way to capture the data in a file.
Copy this file from the companyrouter to your host and verify you can
analyze this file with wireshark (on your host).
    - `sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w ping.pcap icmp` on companyrouter, then ping on win10
    - store public ssh key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    - `scp vagrant@192.168.100.253:/home/vagrant/ping.pcap .`
- SSH from win10 to the companyrouter. When scanning with tcpdump you will now see a lot of SSH traffic passing by. How can you start tcpdump and filter out this ssh traffic?
    - `sudo tcpdump -i eth1 net 172.30.0.0/16 and not port 22`
- Start the web machine. Find a way to capture
only HTTP traffic and only from and to the webserver-machine. Test this
out by browsing to http://www.insecure.cyb from the isprouter machine
using curl. This is a website that should be available in the lab
environment. Are you able to see this HTTP traffic? Browse on the win10
client, are you able to see the same HTTP traffic in tcpdump, why is
this the case?
- 
    - `tcpdump -i eth1 host src 172.30.0.10 and dst 172.30.0.10`
    - to be able to reach the web machine from the isprouter there needs to be
        - a static route added at the bottom of `/etc/network/interfaces
        post-up ip route add 172.30.0.0/16 via 192.168.100.253`
        - and a entry in the `/etc/hosts` file:
        `172.30.0.4 www.insecure.cyb`
    - the website isn’t reachable on port 80 or 443, so I logged into the web machine and checked where the website was listening on by using
    `ss -pant` . There I found port 8000 listening, bingo.
    - now i can `curl` from the isprouter:
        
        ```bash
        isprouter:~$ curl http://www.insecure.cyb:8000

    - The traffic is visible in tcpdump, but is not labeled as http but as irdmi
    - The traffic from and to win10 is not visible bc it does not pass the monitored interface
