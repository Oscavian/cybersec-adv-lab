`watch -n 1 "nft -n list table inet filter"` watch if firewall rules are working (don't forget counter keyword in rule)

## Open, Closed, Filtered Ports

Finish by performing a nmap scan to the web machine on ports 80, 22 and 666. For port 80 you should see ‚Äúopen‚Äù, what do you notice on port 22 and 666? Can you explain this result? Make your firewall insecure again and rerun the scan, analyze the differences. We expect you to learn and know the difference between open/closed/filtered!
