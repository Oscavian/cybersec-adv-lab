# Firewall

I'm configuring the `companyrouter` with `nftables`.

`nftables` implements the following [netfilter hooks](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Netfilter_hooks):

![](../img/nf-hooks.png)

Since we are a router, we especially need to take a closer look at the forward hook since most traffic will just pass us.

## Goals

### Basic

- All internal traffic in the `172.30.0.0/16` subnet should be allowed.
  - this includes routing between the three subnets
- Incoming and forwarded traffic from the "fake" internet **192.168.100.0/24** should be blocked, except:
  - traffic to the `web` machine at `172.30.20.10` resp. the subnet `172.30.20.0/24`

### Additional Services

- allow OpenVPN UDP traffic to the `companyrouter`
- allow access to the Wazuh dashboard on `172.30.0.22` from the host machine

## Script

My Firewall script can be found [here](../scripts/nftables/new-firewall.nft).

To apply it,
- copy it to the `companyrouter`
- make it executable `chmod +x new-firewall.nft`
- run it `sudo ./new-firewall.nft`

To revert, just run `revert-firewall.nft` or

```sh
nft flush table ip filter
nft delete table ip filter
```

`watch -n 1 "nft -n list table inet filter"` watch if firewall rules are working (don't forget counter keyword in rule)


## Open, Closed, Filtered Ports

> Finish by performing a nmap scan to the web machine on ports 80, 22 and 666. For port 80 you should see “open”, what do you notice on port 22 and 666? Can you explain this result? Make your firewall insecure again and rerun the scan, analyze the differences. We expect you to learn and know the difference between open/closed/filtered!

**Firewall on (drop):**
```sh
┌──(kali㉿red)-[~]
└─$ nmap 172.30.20.10 -p 80,22,666
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-09 13:39 EST
Nmap scan report for www.insecure.cyb (172.30.20.10)
Host is up (0.00061s latency).

PORT    STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp  filtered ssh  # intended, ssh not reachable
80/tcp  open     http # intended, dmz access
666/tcp filtered doom # indication a firewall is running
```

**Firewall on (reject):**
```sh
┌──(kali㉿red)-[~]
└─$ nmap 172.30.20.10 -p 80,22,666
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-09 14:04 EST
Nmap scan report for www.insecure.cyb (172.30.20.10)
Host is up (0.00034s latency).

PORT    STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp  closed ssh # connection got rejected
80/tcp  open   http
666/tcp closed doom 

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.02 seconds
```

**Firewall off:**
```sh
┌──(kali㉿red)-[~]
└─$ nmap 172.30.20.10 -p 80,22,666
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-09 13:42 EST
Nmap scan report for www.insecure.cyb (172.30.20.10)
Host is up (0.00082s latency).

PORT    STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp  open   ssh
80/tcp  open   http
666/tcp closed doom

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.03 seconds
```

**Explaination:**

> https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html

- Open -> Port actively accepts TCP/UDP connections
- Closed -> Port is accessible (by nmap probes), but there is no application listening on it OR a firewall is actively rejecting the packets
- Filtered -> nmap can't determine if a port is open or closed. Some firewall application is most likely dropping the packages.
